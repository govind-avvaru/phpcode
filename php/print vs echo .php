<?php
//echo has no return value while print is more like php function so it returns value,which is always set to 1
//echo takes multiple arguments but print takes only one argument.
//echo is marginally faster than print


echo"hi","hello","welcome";

print"<br>";

echo"hi","hello","welcome";

//print "hi","hello","welcome";//error due to multiple argument passing by ","
